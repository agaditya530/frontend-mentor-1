## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

I learn about media queries and handling padding and margin.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="card">
    <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-image.png" width="100%">
    <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
```
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 667px) {
      .card {
      width: 45%; 
    }
    .attribution {
      margin: 18% auto 0; 
    }
    }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I think i need to do alot of projects, feeling line i am weak in frontend.
